        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your stake is locked on the XRP Ledger when you commit to a goal</li>
                <li>Money goes back to you if you succeed, or to charity if you fail</li>
                <li><strong>Commit:</strong> A time-bounded escrow is created with your chosen charity hard-wired as the destination</li>
                <li><strong>Resolve:</strong> Upload proof before your window closes to mark a win — miss it and funds auto-release to charity</li>
                <li><strong>Refund:</strong> After the 24-hour deadline, successful users can claim their stake back to their wallet</li>
                <li>BetOnMe acts as a referee, not a bank — it can never change where your money goes</li>
                <li>Blockchain executes first — XRPL transactions happen before our database even updates</li>
                <li>Goal state and chain state are kept separate, so you can batch refunds on your own schedule</li>
            </ul>
